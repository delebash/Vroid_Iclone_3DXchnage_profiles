# Vroid_Iclone_3DXchnage_profiles
3DXchange for conversion from Vroid Character to iClone

These are two file presets you can load into 3DXchange when converting a Vroid(.vrm) to iClone.

Load **characterizion_profile.3dxProfile** in 3DXchange when you choose Convert to Non-Standard Screen.  In the upper right corner you will see a Load button next to the words Characterization Profile.  Load this file and all bones will be mapped.

Load **expression_editor_profile.3dxFaceAnimProfile** in the Expression Editor which is available on the main 3DXchange screen after you convert your character from the Convert to Non-Standard Screen
